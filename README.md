### What is this repository for? ###
* This repository includes both iterative and recursive implementations of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
* Unit tests are provided to validate the correctness of recursive implementations
* A performance test script is included to compare the execution times of the iterative and recursive approaches.
* Version: 0.1

### How do I get set up? ###
1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/WChan21/floyds.git
    cd floyds

2. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt



### Running the scripts ###
1. Run the Iterative Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

python src/iterative/iterative_floyd.py

2. Run the Recursive Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

python src/recursion/recursive_floyd.py

3. Run Unit Tests

python src/tests/unittests.py

4. Run Performance Tests
python src/tests/performance_test.py

### Requirements ### 

1. Python 3.8+

2. The following Python libraries:

    * unittest (for unit testing)

    * time (for performance measurement)

    * sys (for path management)

To install all dependencies, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
